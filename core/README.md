# Factoidstore

Project in development, based on vertx. 

## Aim

Data is a big issue. Data is big, and it's about big data. There is SQL and NoSQL. There's also event sourcing. And there are programming design patterns and architectures. Mapping between databases and domain logic isn't always easy, or pretty damn'd hard in other cases.

So, one day I just thought, why not develop a kind of event store in which CQRS is embedded. So this is it, a first attempt, but in development.
